 ABOUT:
 
 A PHP/MySQL tool for analysing xferlog and glftpd.log from glftpd.
 xferlogDB reads the log files from glftpd and adds the data to a MySQL 
 database.

 The rest is done by PHP scripts.

 It's tested with glftpd log files.

 
 
 INSTALL:

 Required a MySQL/Apache server running (with PHP support) and read access 
 to the glftpd log file
 - create a database on your MySQL server (eg. xferlogdb)
 - create the tables, use the 'xferlogdb_tables.sql' script
 - copy the PHP scripts and the 'styles.css' to a folder on your webserver
 - rename 'dbconnect.php.new' to 'dbconnect.php'
 - edit the 'dbconnect.php'
   (the 'xferlog', 'glftpd.log' file path, the ftp site root and MySQL user/passwd/host)
 - that's it


 USAGE:

 Run the 'update.php' through the browser to update the stat.
 Example, http://localhost/xferlogDB/update.php 
 You can also use the "update.php" script in a cron job to update your database.
 If you know PHP, feel free to edit the scripts - if not let me know if you
 need more features.


 HINT:

 Keep the glftpd.log and xferlog as small as possible. Since update.php
 require reading the whole log file and update MySQL.

 For example, in FreeBSD, you can add the following lines to /etc/newsyslog
 /glftpd/ftp-data/logs/xferlog       644  7     100  *     B
 /glftpd/ftp-data/logs/glftpd.log    644  7     100  *     B
